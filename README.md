## Description

This project uses Node.Js to generate a team profile by using the command line. The user is prompted with questions in the terminal. The terminal will take the answers given by the user and will generate an HTML webpage that will display all of the information that the user had inputted. In addition to generating the HTML webpage, the project also required the use of Jest to conduct tests on each part of the code.
